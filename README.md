# recipeRecall
 A native ios app for browsing recipes using TheMealDB (https://themealdb.com/api.php).

The start of this application is to pull all the desserts in a call and display them. When the user selects an option the name, ingredients and measurements should show.

7/19/2024 - Working on the detail view, the desserts display otherwise.
